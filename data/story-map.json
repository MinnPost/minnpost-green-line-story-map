It’s just some tables and lights strung overhead, emptying out into the tangle of apartment stoops and stacked kayaks from next-door Midwest Mountaineering behind the buildings. This alley is also the entrance to independent radio station KFAI’s studios, which means you might get lucky enough to see your favorite host coming or going (I’m a Ron “Boogiemonster” Gerber man myself)."

It’s just some tables and lights strung overhead, emptying out into the tangle of apartment stoops and stacked kayaks from next-door Midwest Mountaineering behind the buildings. This alley is also the entrance to independent radio station KFAI’s studios, which means you might get lucky enough to see your favorite host coming or going (I’m a Ron “Boogiemonster” Gerber man myself).</p>"

Between semesters, it’s pretty quiet, with a few townies watching the hockey playoffs the night I dropped in. Pieces of the old Memorial Stadium and Mariucci Arena are here, but the best piece of Gopheriana is in the back room. It’s an autographed triptych of Minnesota alum and future Vikings head coach Bud Grant, pictured in three action-packed photos suited up in his basketball, football and baseball attire. Grant lettered in all three sports while at the U. He’s still the only athlete ever to have played in the NFL and the NBA at the same time, during the 1950 season.</p>"

Aside from the singing, seeing the videos that accompany most of these songs is their own reward. Singing in a noraebang, as these karaoke rooms are called in Korea, is a much different, much more intimate experience than watching a college bro sing Journey for hooting, disinterested drunk people in a bar. It’s just you, your friends, and whatever songs you know. Since there’s no alcohol served, Boomtown doesn’t need to close when the bars do, which means you can stay until 4 a.m. on weekends.</p>"

A block or two east of the platform there’s an interesting example of how historical buildings can be renovated out of existence over the course of decades. At the corner of Malcolm Ave. and 4th Street, there’s a thoroughly unremarkable siding-and-stucco duplex – it looks like typical student housing, even down to the discarded red Solo cups on the back porch. Buried beneath the stucco duplex drag, there’s an old farmhouse, dating from 1865. It was built by members of the Eustis family, who farmed on the land before it was platted into Prospect Park. It’s easily one of the oldest houses in this part of Minneapolis, though you’d never know by looking at it. The chimney on top looks like it might be the only visible remnant.</p>"

The front window is given over completely to a silver tinsel-backed display of handwritten slogans and signage related to education, health care and immigration. On the side of the building is a collection of quotations culminating in the hopeful assertion that “We are on the verge of a GREAT AMERICAN RENAISSANCE.” Inside, Sengupta himself is usually at the center of things, unmistakable in his pharmacist’s jacket and shock of white hair.</p>"

Soth’s studio is located a block north of the billboard on Raymond, in a one-story office building with the auspicious name of “Lakes and Plains.” Though the studio is not usually open to the public, you can drop by Big Al’s next door, Soth’s printing and scanning service, which works with photographers all over the country. Incidentally, the studio is widely known in the artistic community as a hotbed of table tennis activity. Each employee apparently has his/her own nickname. I knew a guy who dropped in for a match recently. “Who you’d play?” I asked. “I don’t know,” he said. “They just called him ‘The Gravedigger.’ ”</p>"

One such site, called Union Park, was located here in the 19th  century. While it’s long gone, its physical footprint – the loping, off-grid streets – and its name remain. “Artistic and beautiful winding roads” was how the Union Park neighborhood was sold to eager homesteaders, once the land was platted. There are still a number of modest, attractive Victorian homes along tiny, green Iris Park. This was also one of the stops for the Short Line between the two cities, so like many places in the area, you can walk from a quiet sylvan setting into an industrial site on a railroad track in less than three blocks. There are some great hand-painted murals on some of the nearby businesses, buffering the residential and industrial areas, including this smiley Max Fleischman-style dog at M&J Auto Repair.</p>"

But even if you don’t need 45-degree on-off electrical switches, surplus German military berets, or thousands and thousands of tiny glass bottles, you should still drop by to appreciate the hilarious cardboard-Sharpie-and-collage signage.

There’s a great, inexpensively priced selection, but maybe the best part of the shop is the wall of fame in the back. Almost anyone who’s anyone in hip-hop has stopped in over the last two decades while on tour, and most have left some kind of signed artifact behind. Some even before they were famous – Tim mentioned a time in 1994 or so when they cleared out the back for a freestyle battle with two guys from Atlanta calling themselves OutKast whose first album had just come out. Joining them was a very young Slug of Atmosphere, a few years away form his first album. To have been in attendance for something like that is one of those mythical stories people tell their friends for years. All those mythical stories are preserved in the glass case in the back of Urban Lights.</p>"

Buried beneath the stucco duplex drag, there’s an old farmhouse, dating from 1865. It was built by members of the Eustis family, who farmed on the land before it was platted into Prospect Park. It’s easily one of the oldest houses in this part of Minneapolis, though you’d never know by looking at it.
